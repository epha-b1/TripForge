# Required Document Description: Business Logic Questions Log

This file records business-level ambiguities from the prompt and implementation decisions.
Each entry follows exactly: Question + My Understanding/Hypothesis + Solution.

## 1) Organizer vs Admin Data Scope — What Roles Exist?
Question: The prompt mentions "Organizer" and "Admin" as example roles with different data scopes. Are these the only roles, or are there more?
My Understanding/Hypothesis: The system ships with two seed roles: `admin` (full access) and `organizer` (own-data access). Additional roles can be created via the RBAC API. The data-scope rule is enforced at the service layer: Organizer queries are always filtered by `owner_id = currentUser.id`.
Solution: RBAC middleware checks permission points. A separate data-scope check in the itinerary service filters by owner_id for non-admin users.

## 2) Device Registration — What Is a Device Fingerprint?
Question: The prompt says devices are registered with a fingerprint hash. Who generates this fingerprint — the client or the server?
My Understanding/Hypothesis: The client generates and sends a device fingerprint string (e.g., hash of browser/app metadata). The server stores a bcrypt/SHA-256 hash of it. The server does not generate fingerprints.
Solution: `POST /auth/login` accepts optional `deviceFingerprint` string. Server hashes it before storing. If not provided, a server-generated UUID is used as the device identifier.

## 3) Unusual Location Detection — What Triggers a Challenge?
Question: The prompt says unusual-location detection is based on "last-known city string supplied by the client." What exactly triggers a challenge — any city change, or only a significant one?
My Understanding/Hypothesis: Any change in city string compared to the device's stored `last_known_city` triggers a challenge prompt. The challenge is a rate-limited 429 response with a `challengeToken`. The client must re-submit with the challenge token to proceed.
Solution: On login, compare `lastKnownCity` to `device.last_known_city`. If different and device is known, return 429 with a short-lived challenge token (5 min TTL). Client re-submits with `challengeToken` to confirm the new location.

## 4) Refresh Token — Per Device or Per User?
Question: The prompt says refresh tokens have a 14-day TTL. Are they scoped per device or per user?
My Understanding/Hypothesis: Refresh tokens are scoped per device. Each device gets its own refresh token. Revoking a device also revokes its refresh token. A user can have up to 5 active refresh tokens (one per device).
Solution: `refresh_tokens` table has `device_id` FK. Deleting a device cascades to its refresh token.

## 5) Itinerary Conflict — 15-Minute Buffer — Is It Configurable?
Question: The prompt says "default minimum buffer of 15 minutes between items." Does "default" imply it can be changed per itinerary or per user?
My Understanding/Hypothesis: The 15-minute buffer is a system-wide default enforced on all itineraries. It is not configurable per itinerary or user in this version. The word "default" in the prompt is treated as a fixed constant.
Solution: Buffer constant defined in config (e.g., `MIN_BUFFER_MINUTES=15`). Validation service uses this constant.

## 6) Travel Time Matrix — Is It Bidirectional?
Question: The travel time matrix stores from/to pairs. Is travel time assumed to be symmetric (A→B = B→A), or must both directions be stored?
My Understanding/Hypothesis: Travel times are not assumed symmetric (e.g., uphill vs downhill). Both directions must be stored explicitly. If a direction is missing, the validation service skips the travel time check for that pair (does not block scheduling).
Solution: `travel_time_matrices` stores directed pairs. Validation service looks up `(from, to)` specifically. Missing entry = no travel time constraint applied.

## 7) Itinerary Versioning — What Triggers a New Version?
Question: The prompt says "every save creates a versioned revision record." Does this mean every PATCH to the itinerary, or only when items are added/removed/moved?
My Understanding/Hypothesis: A new version is created on every mutation that changes the itinerary's content: adding/removing/updating items, and updating itinerary metadata (title, dates). Simple status changes (draft → published) do not create a new version.
Solution: Version creation is triggered in the service layer after any content-changing operation. Diff metadata compares the new snapshot to the previous version's snapshot.

## 8) Share Token — Can It Be Revoked?
Question: The prompt says share tokens are valid for 7 days. Can the owner revoke a share token before it expires?
My Understanding/Hypothesis: Yes — calling `POST /itineraries/:id/share` again generates a new token and invalidates the previous one. There is no explicit revoke endpoint; re-generating is the revocation mechanism.
Solution: `itineraries.share_token` is overwritten on each call to the share endpoint. Old tokens become invalid immediately.

## 9) Import Deduplication — What Happens to Duplicates?
Question: The prompt says deduplication uses a configurable key. When a duplicate is detected, is the row skipped, updated, or flagged as an error?
My Understanding/Hypothesis: Duplicates are skipped (not updated, not errored). The validation report marks them as `skipped_duplicate` with the matching existing record ID. The user can override this behavior by passing `deduplicationStrategy: upsert` to update existing records.
Solution: Import service checks for existing records by dedup key before insert. Default behavior: skip. Optional `deduplicationStrategy` param supports `skip` (default) or `upsert`.

## 10) Model Inference — How Are PMML/ONNX Models Executed?
Question: The prompt says inference runs via "Java-side adapters (PMML/ONNX or custom process)." Does this mean a Java subprocess is spawned, or is there a Java service running alongside?
My Understanding/Hypothesis: For this implementation, PMML/ONNX inference is handled by spawning a child process (Node.js `child_process.spawn`) that calls a bundled Java JAR or Python script. The adapter pattern abstracts the execution method. For the submission, a mock adapter is provided that returns deterministic fake results, with the real adapter interface documented.
Solution: `ModelAdapter` interface with `infer(input, config): Promise<InferenceResult>`. Implementations: `PmmlAdapter`, `OnnxAdapter`, `CustomAdapter`. Each spawns the appropriate process. A `MockAdapter` is used in tests.

## 11) Notification Frequency Cap — Per Day or Rolling Window?
Question: The prompt says "per-user frequency caps (default 20 messages/day)." Is this a calendar day (midnight reset) or a rolling 24-hour window?
My Understanding/Hypothesis: Calendar day reset at midnight UTC. A `daily_message_count` counter is reset by a scheduled job at midnight. This is simpler and more predictable than a rolling window.
Solution: `user_notification_settings` stores `daily_cap` (default 20). A cron job resets a `daily_sent_count` counter at midnight UTC. Notification service checks count before sending.

## 12) Password Recovery — How Many Security Questions?
Question: The prompt says password recovery uses security questions but doesn't specify how many are required.
My Understanding/Hypothesis: Users must set exactly 2 security questions at registration. Recovery requires correct answers to both. Questions are free-text (user writes their own question and answer).
Solution: Registration validates that exactly 2 security questions are provided. Recovery endpoint requires both answers to match (AES-256 decrypt + compare).

## 13) Idempotency Keys — Which Operations Require Them?
Question: The prompt says "idempotency keys for all mutating operations." Does this mean every POST/PATCH/DELETE, or only specific high-risk operations?
My Understanding/Hypothesis: Idempotency keys are required on: order-like operations (import upload/commit), model inference calls, and any operation explicitly marked in the API spec. Standard CRUD (create resource, update itinerary) does not require idempotency keys unless the client provides one voluntarily.
Solution: Idempotency middleware checks for `Idempotency-Key` header on POST requests. If present, stores and deduplicates. Required on: `POST /import/upload`, `POST /import/:id/commit`. Optional on all other POSTs.

## 14) A/B Allocation — How Is the Group Determined?
Question: The prompt mentions A/B allocations and canary rollouts for models. How is a user assigned to a group?
My Understanding/Hypothesis: Group assignment is deterministic based on a hash of `userId + modelName`. This ensures the same user always gets the same model version, avoiding inconsistent experiences. Percentage thresholds determine group boundaries.
Solution: `hash(userId + modelName) % 100` determines the user's bucket. If bucket < canary percentage, use canary model; otherwise use active model.

## 15) Audit Log — Which Actions Are Logged?
Question: The prompt says "full auditability of permission changes" and "immutable" audit logs. What is the full list of audited actions?
My Understanding/Hypothesis: Audited actions include: login, logout, password change, device registration/removal, user create/update/delete, role create/update/delete, permission assignment, itinerary create/update/delete, import commit/rollback, model activation, notification send.
Solution: Audit middleware intercepts responses and logs action + resource_type + resource_id + actor_id + IP. Sensitive fields (password_hash, encrypted answers) are masked as `[REDACTED]` in the detail JSON.

## 16) Device Cap — What Happens at 5 Active Devices?
Question: The prompt caps devices at 5 active per user. What happens when a 6th login occurs?
My Understanding/Hypothesis: The login is rejected with a 409 error until the user removes an existing device via `DELETE /auth/devices/{id}`. No automatic eviction.
Solution: On login, if a new device would exceed the cap, return `409 DEVICE_LIMIT_REACHED` and include the current device list so the client can prompt removal.

## 17) Unusual-Location Challenge — What Rate Limit Applies?
Question: The prompt requires rate-limited challenge prompts for unusual locations, but does not define the limit or window.
My Understanding/Hypothesis: Allow up to 3 challenge prompts per user per hour. Further attempts return `429` with a `retryAfterSeconds` value.
Solution: Store challenge attempts in a rolling 1-hour window keyed by user+device. Enforce the cap before issuing a new challenge token.

## 18) Missing Business Hours/Closures — How Should Validation Behave?
Question: If a resource lacks business hours or closure dates, should scheduling be blocked or allowed?
My Understanding/Hypothesis: Missing hours/closures mean no restriction is applied. Scheduling is allowed as long as overlap/buffer/dwell rules pass.
Solution: Validation checks business hours and closures only when data exists; otherwise it skips those constraints.

## 19) Itinerary Export — What Is the Standard Package Format?
Question: The prompt requires exporting a standardized itinerary package but does not specify format.
My Understanding/Hypothesis: Export is a JSON payload with a `schemaVersion`, itinerary metadata, day items, and linked resources; no zip container.
Solution: `GET /itineraries/{id}/export` returns `application/json` with the standardized schema and a `schemaVersion` field for forward compatibility.

## 20) Model Artifacts — How Are Files Stored or Loaded?
Question: Model registration is defined, but there is no upload endpoint. Where do PMML/ONNX artifacts live?
My Understanding/Hypothesis: Model files are placed manually in the local `models/` directory and referenced by a `filePath` in the model `config`. No network downloads.
Solution: The model registry stores metadata + `config.filePath`. Adapters load files from disk only.

## 21) Rule-and-Model Decisioning — Which Takes Precedence?
Question: The prompt requires combined rule-and-model decisioning. If rules and model disagree, which wins?
My Understanding/Hypothesis: Rules are hard constraints and override the model. The model provides a suggestion only when rules pass.
Solution: Apply rules first; if any rule blocks, return a rule-based decision with `appliedRules`. Otherwise return the model prediction with the rule summary included.

## 22) Request IDs — What If the Client Omits X-Request-Id?
Question: The prompt mandates request IDs on every request. Should the server generate one when absent?
My Understanding/Hypothesis: Yes. The server generates a UUID if `X-Request-Id` is missing and echoes it back in responses and logs.
Solution: Request-id middleware sets `req.id` from header or generates one, then adds `X-Request-Id` to the response.
